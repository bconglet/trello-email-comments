Trello CC Email Comments to Card Using Cloudmailin

This allows you to add an email address CC'ed to your emails to a client or contactor, and have the reply dump into a card including attachements

## How to Use:

You take the card ID *(if this is the url of a card https://trello.com/c/X2Mbg3oE/2-TestCard the id would be X2Mbg3oE)* and you use it at the email X2Mbg3oE@customdomain.com or X2Mbg3oE@cloudmailinaddress.com

Then, you point that to the location this script in installed and it will add any new comments to the card, along with the email it came from.

You must first authorize this "app" to use trello, this is accomplished by the commented code at the beginning of the script.
